### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I am a PhD student at theÂ IDHEAPÂ of the University of Lausanne under the supervision ofÂ Giuliano BonoliÂ andÂ Rafael Lalive. I am broadly interested in the use of predictions in the social sciences and for public policy. Before starting my PhD, I worked as a data scientist in the Lufthansa Group and graduated with a MSc from theÂ University of Konstanz.
